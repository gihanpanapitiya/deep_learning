deep learning documentation
===========================

Add your content using ``reStructuredText`` syntax. See the
`reStructuredText <https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/usage/restructuredtext/index.html>`_
documentation for details.


The notebooks are presented in the first hour of every group tutorial session.
During the tutorial sessions, we will present the content and explain the implementation of the notebooks.
You can decide yourself whether you just want to look at the filled notebook, want to try it yourself, or code along during the practical session.
The notebooks are not directly part of any mandatory assignments on which you would be graded or similarly.
However, we encourage you to get familiar with the notebooks and experiment or extend them yourself.
Further, the content presented will be relevant for the graded assignment and exam.
